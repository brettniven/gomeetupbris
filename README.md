# Go Meetup Brisbane, May 2019

NOTE: This repo has been copied from a private project and package names altered accordingly.

This has been published to show the test pattern described in the session.
It will be of no use as an actual service as to run, it requires a grpc server and appropriate runtime config

The tests however will run fine. I've committed the vendor dir as some lib dependencies would otherwise be non-go-gettable as they live in private repos.
